## Description

This project involves:
- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and patterns.
- Decomposing time series data into trend, periodicity, and noise components.
- Applying statistical and machine learning methods for anomaly detection, including:
  - Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL)
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)
  - Isolation Forest
- Evaluating the results of anomaly detection methods.
